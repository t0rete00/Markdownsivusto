# My website using markdown

Welcome to my simple **website**. I have used only markdown with this site.

## About Me

I'm a student but in the *early days* I've done various things such as:

> was a riding instructor
> took care of horses in trotting stable
> worked in a post office 
> got bored and left to United States for a year to be an ***au pair***
> worked in a travelling office when came back
> worked as a cleaner in a hospital department of oncology - _sad years and lost a lot of people who I got to know_
> while working as a cleaner, had a vision to become a typist - _got the job_



Thank you for visiting!
