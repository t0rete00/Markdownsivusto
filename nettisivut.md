# My simple website using markdown

Welcome to my simple **website**. I have used only markdown with this site.

## About me

I'm a student but in the *early days* I've done various things such as:

> I studied to be a riding instructor. I never worked in this field.
>
> After graduating I took care of horses in a trotting stable until I injured from knee.
>
> Then I decided to go to high school and started working in a post office.
>
> I got bored and left to United States for a year to be an ***au pair***. I had great time exploring the country.
>
> I worked in a travelling office and continued my high school studies when I came back.
>
> Then I worked as a cleaner in a hospital department of oncology - _sad years and lost a lot of people who I got to know_.
>
> While working as a cleaner, had a vision to become a typist - _got the job_. Then started to work in the ER as a medical typist and transferred to a private company a year later. I still work there as a part time typist.
